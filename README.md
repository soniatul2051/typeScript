# typeScript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types to your code, allowing for early error detection and better tooling. It supports features like interfaces, enums, generics, and modules, making it ideal for large-scale applications. TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, enabling it to run in any environment where JavaScript runs.
